# FirstWebsite

A beginner-friendly landing page showcasing fundamental frontend development skills. This project demonstrates core HTML and CSS concepts including responsive design, layout techniques, and interactive elements.

## Overview

This is my first website project - a simple yet well-structured landing page built with pure HTML and CSS. It serves as a foundation for understanding web development basics and demonstrates key concepts like positioning, floats, and responsive design.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes for optimal viewing on various devices
- **Float-based Layout**: Uses CSS floats for structuring the middle container section
- **Absolute Positioning**: Images are positioned absolutely within their relative parent containers in the top section
- **Interactive Links**: Hyperlinks change color on hover to provide visual feedback
- **Clean Structure**: Organized HTML structure with semantic elements

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3

## What I Learned

Building this project helped me understand several fundamental CSS concepts:

- **Floats and Clearfix**: Learned how to use floats for layout and the importance of clearing floats to prevent layout issues
- **Positioning**: Gained experience with absolute positioning relative to parent containers, which was particularly challenging but essential for precise element placement
- **Hyperlinks**: Understood how to create navigation links to other pages and use placeholder links with the `#` symbol

## Getting Started

Since this is a static HTML/CSS project, you can simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view it locally. No build process or dependencies are required.

## Future Improvements

- Add more interactive elements
- Implement additional pages
- Enhance the responsive design for mobile devices
- Add animations and transitions
